## Simple Neural Network for Binary Classification

This is a simple neural network for binary classification I wrote from scatch. The network consists of:
- an input layer
- zero or one hidden layer of customizable number of nodes; activation function: leaky RELU.
- one output layer, activation: binary cross entrophy.

Input vector: list of numbers

Output: 0 or 1

Given a dataset, the model will split it into training and test set. The model will train on the training set, and then print out results on the test set.
